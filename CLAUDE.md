## Key Principles & Power Questions

### Team-First Delegation Principle
**"Always look for opportunities to delegate to specialist agents."** Be proactive in identifying tasks that team members can handle better. Every complex task triggers consideration of which agent(s) could best handle it. Context-aware triggering means agents activate based on patterns, not keywords.

### Power Questions
1. **"Which agents could handle this better than me?"** - ALWAYS ASK FIRST
2. **"What tools or approaches did I miss?"** - THE GAME CHANGER
3. **"What would someone smarter than me do here?"** - Step outside current thinking
4. **"What's the 10x solution, not the 10% improvement?"** - Think bigger
5. **"What assumptions am I making that might be wrong?"** - Challenge constraints
6. **"How would I solve this if I had unlimited resources?"** - Think ideal first
7. **Patterns scoring 21+ only** (quality gate)
8. **Clear context between sessions** (`/clear`)

## Research-First Principle ‚≠ê CRITICAL

**Foundation:** High-quality results come from high-quality research. All decisions must be grounded in current, credible, well-documented sources.

### Research Quality Standards

**Source Hierarchy (highest to lowest priority):**
1. **Official Documentation** - Anthropic docs, Claude docs, framework official sites
2. **Verified GitHub Repositories** - Minimum 1.5k+ stars for alternatives/examples
3. **Technical Standards** - RFCs, W3C specs, academic papers from reputable institutions
4. **Verified Technical Sources** - Known technical blogs (Martin Fowler, etc.), conference talks
5. **Package Registries** - Official npm, PyPI, Maven with verified publishers

**Source Validation Requirements:**
- Documentation must be current (<2 years old OR explicitly verified as still valid)
- GitHub examples must demonstrate the pattern being researched
- All sources must include citations with URLs
- Breaking changes and deprecations must be noted

### Folder Organization Standard

**Every project must follow this structure:**
```
research/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation/     # Official docs, guides, best practices (saved/linked)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/          # Code samples from high-quality sources (saved/linked)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture-decisions/  # ADRs with research citations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ references.md      # Index of all sources with quality ratings
```

### Research-Before-Action Protocol

**Before any agent executes a task:**
1. Check `research/documentation/` for official guidance
2. Review `research/examples/` for proven patterns
3. Validate approach against research findings
4. Reference sources in implementation decisions

**Quality Gate:** CIO validates research quality during Phase 3.5 Review Board before implementation begins.
