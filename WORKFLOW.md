# 6-Phase Project Workflow System
## Including C-Suite Review Board Quality Gate

## Overview

The 6-Phase Project Workflow System provides a structured approach to building projects in Claude Code. From user-created project brief through C-suite review to final testing, each phase has specific deliverables, assigned agents, and quality gates to ensure successful project completion.

**Philosophy:** Plan thoroughly before executing. Each phase builds on the previous, with explicit user approval required between phases. Phase 3.5 adds a C-suite Review Board quality gate before expensive implementation begins.

**Key Enhancements (v3.1.0):**
- **Explicit Approval Workflow**: No automatic phase transitions
- **Phase 0**: User-created project brief required before Phase 1
- **Phase 3.5**: C-suite Review Board (CIO, CTO, COO) quality gate
- **Project-Specific Databases**: Isolated SQLite database per project
- **Just-in-Time Documents**: Phase documents created only when phase starts
- **Loop-Back Mechanism**: Review Board can reject and return to Phase 3

## The 6 Phases

### Phase 0: Project Brief üìù
**User-Created Prerequisite (Before Phase 1)**

**Purpose:** Define the problem, requirements, and constraints before starting the workflow.

**Created By:** User (not Claude)

**Template Location:** `templates/phases/00-project-brief-template.md`

**Required Sections:**
1. **Problem Statement** - What problem are we solving? What's the impact?
2. **Goals & Success Metrics** - What does success look like? How will we measure it?
3. **Requirements** - Must-have, should-have, and nice-to-have features
4. **Constraints** - Budget, timeline, technical, resource limitations
5. **Reference Materials** - Links, examples, inspiration, existing solutions
6. **User Experience** - How should it feel? What's the user journey?
7. **Success Metrics** - KPIs, acceptance criteria, measurable outcomes
8. **Risks & Assumptions** - What could go wrong? What are we assuming?
9. **Stakeholders** - Who cares? Who will use it? Who approves it?
10. **Additional Context** - Anything else we should know?

**Deliverable:** Project brief document

---

### Phase 3.5: Review Board üîç
**C-Suite Executive Approval Gate (Quality Gate Before Implementation)**

**Purpose:** Executive validation before expensive implementation begins. Prevents costly rework by catching issues early.

**Primary Agents (3 C-suite Executives):**
- **CIO** (Chief Information Officer): Reviews intelligence, research quality, dependencies, documentation
- **CTO** (Chief Technology Officer): Reviews technical architecture, code approach, APIs, feasibility
- **COO** (Chief Operations Officer): Reviews operational capacity, goal achievement, UX/UI, beauty

**Activities:**
1. **CIO Review**: Validates mission research supports execution plan
   - Are all dependencies identified and documented?
   - Is research complete with examples and references?
   - Do we have the documentation we need?
   - Are UI/UX preferences captured?

2. **CTO Review**: Validates technical soundness of execution plan
   - Is the architecture feasible?
   - Are the APIs well-designed?
   - Is the code approach solid?
   - Can we actually build this?

3. **COO Review**: Validates plan achieves project goals
   - Does this accomplish the original goals?
   - Will users actually use it?
   - Is it beautiful and well-designed?
   - Do we have capacity to execute?

**Deliverables:**
- 3 individual executive review reports
- Consolidated verdict with recommendations
- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/review-board/session-<N>/`

**Possible Verdicts:**
- ‚úÖ **APPROVED**: All executives approve, proceed to Phase 4 (Implementation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **APPROVED_WITH_CONCERNS**: Proceed with noted concerns to address during implementation
- ‚ùå **REJECTED**: Significant issues found, loop back to Phase 3 for revision

**Commands:**
```bash
/start-review-board          # Convene CIO, CTO, COO for evaluation
/approve-review-board        # Accept approval and proceed to Phase 4
/address-review-concerns     # Accept rejection and loop back to Phase 3
```

**Loop-Back Mechanism:**
- If verdict is **REJECTED** and user runs `/address-review-concerns`:
  - Returns to Phase 3 (Execution Planning)
  - Execution plan must be revised based on feedback
  - Must re-approve execution plan
  - Must convene new Review Board session
- Loop continues until **APPROVED** or **APPROVED_WITH_CONCERNS**

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] All 3 executives have submitted reviews
- [ ] Consolidated verdict issued
- [ ] User has reviewed findings
- [ ] User has run `/approve-review-board` (if approved) OR `/address-review-concerns` (if rejected)

---

## Best Practices

### Planning
- Spend adequate time in Phases 1-3
- Don't rush to implementation
- Thorough planning saves execution time
- Validate assumptions early

### Documentation
- Keep deliverable documents updated
- Link between phase documents using [[wiki-style]] links
- Use any markdown editor (VS Code, vim, or Obsidian)
- Version control in Git (everything in `~/.claude/`)

### Agent Coordination
- Let task-manager orchestrate Phase 4
- Trust agent specializations
- Clear handoff protocols
- Regular status updates

### Quality
- Don't skip quality gates
- Test throughout, not just Phase 5
- Code review everything
- Validate against Vision regularly

### Iteration
- Phases are not strictly linear
- Can return to earlier phases if needed
- Update documents as learnings emerge
- Adapt plan based on reality

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot transition" error
- Run `/phase-status` to see blockers
- Ensure deliverable approved
- Complete all required tasks
- Check quality gate criteria

### Missing documents
- Check `~/.claude/projects/`
- Verify workflow created: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/workflow-coordinator.py list`
- Manually copy from `~/.claude/templates/`
- Run `/start-project` to create complete structure

### Agent not activating
- Verify agent exists: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/agent-runner.py list`
- Check phase-agent mapping above
- Task-manager handles orchestration in Phase 4

### Database errors
- Verify database: `ls -la ~/.claude/data/workflow.db`
- Reinitialize if needed: See database schema in workflow-coordinator.py

---

## Examples

### Starting a Feature Project
```bash
# Initialize
/start-project "User Authentication Feature"

# Phase 1: Vision
# Edit Vision document, define requirements
# Approve when ready

# Transition to Phase 2
/start-mission

# Phase 2: Mission
# Research OAuth libraries
/add-dependency "User Authentication Feature" "authlib" "python" "1.2.0"
# Complete Mission document

# Continue through phases...
```

### Checking Progress
```bash
# Quick status
/phase-status "User Authentication Feature"

# Full dashboard
/workflow-dashboard "User Authentication Feature"

# Database view
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/workflow-coordinator.py status <workflow-id>
```
