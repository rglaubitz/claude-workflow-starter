## Communication & Handoff Protocols

### Team Sync Points

**Daily Async Sync (via Database/TodoWrite):**
- All agents update task status daily
- Blockers flagged immediately
- task-manager monitors progress

**Epic Kickoff Meeting:**
- When: Start of each new epic
- Participants: All agents assigned to epic
- Purpose: Align on goals, confirm dependencies, verify readiness

**Epic Retrospective:**
- When: Completion of each epic
- Participants: All agents who worked on epic
- Purpose: Review what went well, identify improvements

### Handoff Protocols

**Backend Team → Frontend Team:**
1. Backend Team completes API endpoints
2. Backend Team updates API documentation
3. Backend Team runs integration tests
4. Backend Team notifies Frontend Team via TodoWrite
5. Frontend Team verifies API contracts
6. Frontend Team confirms readiness to integrate
7. Handoff Status: COMPLETE

**Development Teams → Quality Team:**
1. Dev team completes feature
2. Dev team self-reviews using checklist
3. Dev team creates code-review-expert task
4. code-review-expert reviews and provides feedback
5. Dev team addresses feedback
6. code-review-expert approves
7. Handoff to qa-engineer for testing
8. Handoff Status: COMPLETE

### Blocker Escalation Process

**Level 1 - Agent identifies blocker:**
1. Document in TodoWrite with "BLOCKED" status
2. Attempt self-resolution (1 hour)

**Level 2 - Escalate to Team:**
3. Notify team lead (research-manager, qa-engineer, etc.)
4. Team attempts resolution (4 hours)

**Level 3 - Escalate to task-manager:**
5. task-manager assesses impact
6. If critical path: P0 priority
7. If multiple tasks blocked: P1 priority
8. Otherwise: P2 priority

**Level 4 - Cross-team coordination:**
9. task-manager coordinates cross-team solution
10. Updates all affected agents
11. Adjusts timeline if needed
