# Approve Testing (Phase 5) - PROJECT COMPLETE

You are approving **Phase 5: Testing** and marking the **entire project as COMPLETE**.

## Prerequisites Check

1. **Verify Test Plan exists and all tests pass**:
```python
import os

test_plan_path = f"~/.claude/projects/{project_slug}/05-test-plan.md"
if not os.path.exists(test_plan_path):
    print("‚ùå Test Plan not found")
    print("Run: /start-testing")
    exit()

# Read test plan and check for failures
with open(test_plan_path, 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
    if 'Failed:' in content and not 'Failed: 0' in content:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Test failures detected in Test Plan")
        print("Ensure all tests pass before approving")
```

2. **Validate Vision goals achieved**:
```python
# Prompt user for final validation
print("""
üéØ **VISION GOALS VALIDATION**

Review the Vision document and confirm:
""")

cursor.execute("""
    SELECT document_path FROM deliverables
    WHERE phase_number = 1 AND phase_name = 'vision'
""")
vision_path = cursor.fetchone()[0]

print(f"Vision: {vision_path}")
print(f"Test Plan: {test_plan_path}")
print("\nVerify that all Vision success criteria are validated in the Test Plan.")
```

## Your Task

1. **Generate project completion summary**:
```python
# Get all phase completion data
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT
        phase_number,
        phase_name,
        status,
        approved_at,
        document_path
    FROM deliverables
    ORDER BY phase_number
""")

deliverables = cursor.fetchall()

# Get task statistics
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT
        COUNT(*) as total,
        COUNT(DISTINCT assigned_agent) as agents,
        MIN(created_at) as project_start,
        MAX(completed_at) as project_end
    FROM tasks
""")

total_tasks, total_agents, start_date, end_date = cursor.fetchone()

# Calculate project duration
from datetime import datetime
start = datetime.fromisoformat(start_date)
end = datetime.fromisoformat(end_date)
duration = (end - start).days

print(f"""

**Duration:** {duration} days ({start_date} to {end_date})

""")

for phase_num, phase_name, status, approved_at, doc_path in deliverables:
    print(f"‚úÖ Phase {phase_num} ({phase_name}): {status} - {approved_at}")
    print(f"   Document: {doc_path}")

print(f"""

**Deliverables:**

- Execution Plan ‚úÖ
- Implementation Report ‚úÖ
- Test Plan ‚úÖ
""")
```

2. **Update the database**:
```python
# Mark Testing deliverable as approved
cursor.execute("""
    UPDATE deliverables
    SET status = 'approved',
        approved_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        approved_by = 'user'
    WHERE phase_number = 5 AND phase_name = 'test-plan'
""")

# Update workflow to COMPLETE
cursor.execute("""
    UPDATE workflow
    SET current_phase = 'project-complete',
        phase_number = 5,
        updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE project_slug = ?
""", (project_slug,))

conn.commit()
```

3. **Generate final project report**:
```python
# Create completion report
report_path = f"~/.claude/projects/{project_slug}/PROJECT-COMPLETE.md"

report_content = f"""
# Project Completion Report: {project_name}

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Completed:** {datetime.now().isoformat()}
**Duration:** {duration} days
